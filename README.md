# gh-marking-scripts
Helper scripts to make marking and adding feedback a little easier. These scripts assume that you enabled the automatic pull request for feedback on assignment creation.

The "old" directory has stuff that isn't useful to me personally anymore (Blackboard-specific). `clone_from_csv.py` will clone repos from the CSV downloaded from GitHub classroom and rename folders according to roster identifier, removing the need to strip tokens for push/pull.
